/*Let's create a quick program to translate text to "Whale Speech".*/

//First we'll set up the text we wish to convert. You can use any text you desire, but as a test, we'll use the name of a game.
const input = "Persona Five";

//Set our vowels into an array.
const vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];

//This array will hold the items found in the following loop.
const resultArray = [];

//We'll go through our input until we hit the end. 
for(let i = 0; i < input.length; i++)
  {
    //As we go through our input, we'll compare the string to track down the vowels within.
    for(let j = 0; j < vowels.length; j++)
      {
        //Once we find a vowel, check to see if it is :e" or "u", and, if so, go ahead and push it.
        if(input[i] === vowels[j])
          {
            if(input[i] === "e" || input[i] === "u")
              {
                resultArray.push(vowels[j]);
              }
            
            //Add in the rest of the vowels found via push, including the "e"s and "u"s. As such, they will be doubled.
            resultArray.push(vowels[j]);
          }
      }
  }

//We'll now log our result, ensuring there are no commas to separate and that it is all capitalized.
console.log(resultArray.join("").toUpperCase());
